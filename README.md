# Social Network API

## Description
  
With this assignment we were tasked to create a little api for a social network.  We used express for the routing, mongodb and mongoose for data storage and retrieval.  With the api we are able to provide CRUD for both the users and thoughts.  The api also allows someone to add friends to their friends list as well as reactions to thoughts. It also allows for both of those to be update and deleted as well.

## Installation

npm i inquirer@8.2.4 mongodb mongoose express

## Usage

To run this app you type npm start on the command line.
